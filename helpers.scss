// Optional layer with helper CSS classes to easily adjust visual details.

//
// Helpers
// =======
//
// General purpose helpers for common situations. They can compose multiple CSS rules to do a bit
// more complicated tasks.

@layer helpers {
    @include meta.load-css("styles/helpers/animation");
}

//
// Utilities
// =========
//
// Utility classes to tweak small details like typography, margins or padding. They do just one
// thing: they set a single CSS rule and use the otherwise disallowed `!important` to enforce it.
// Also they are often responsive (can be adjusted for individual breakpoints).

@layer utilities {
    @include meta.load-css("styles/utilities");
}
