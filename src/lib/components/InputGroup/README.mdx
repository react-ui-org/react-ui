# InputGroup

InputGroup visually groups related form fields and actions together.

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import Icon from '../../../docs/_components/Icon'
import {
  Button,
  InputGroup,
  SelectField,
  TextField,
} from '../..'

## Basic Usage

To implement the InputGroup component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { InputGroup } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [fruit, setFruit] = React.useState('apple');
    const options = [
      {
        label: 'Apple',
        value: 'apple',
      },
      {
        label: 'Pear',
        value: 'pear',
      },
      {
        label: 'Cherry',
        value: 'cherry',
      },
    ];
    return (
      <InputGroup label="Your favourite fruit">
        <SelectField
          label="Your favourite fruit"
          onChange={(e) => setFruit(e.target.value)}
          options={options}
          value={fruit}
        />
        <TextField
          label="Variety"
          placeholder="Eg. Golden delicious"
        />
        <Button label="Submit" />
      </InputGroup>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- Use input group to group **related fields and actions** that a user can take.
  Input fields and buttons should not be grouped just to save space on the
  screen.

- While the number of child inputs is not limited, keep in mind the layout of
  InputGroup is currently **not responsive: the inputs do not shrink nor wrap**.
  Make sure your inputs fit their container, especially on small screens.

- InputGroup currently **supports grouping of**
  [TextField](/components/text-field), [SelectField](/components/select-field),
  and [Button](/components/button) components.

- To group [Buttons](/components/button) only, use the
  [ButtonGroup](/components/button-group) component which is designed
  specifically for that purpose.

## Sizes

All existing field and button sizes are also available on the input group level:
small, medium, and large.

<Playground>
  <InputGroup
    label="Small size"
    size="small"
  >
    <TextField label="Input" />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
  <InputGroup label="Medium size">
    <TextField label="Input" />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
  <InputGroup
    label="Large size"
    size="large"
  >
    <TextField label="Input" />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
</Playground>

### Shared Property

You can set the `size` property directly on InputGroup to be shared for all
fields and buttons inside the group. This property is then passed over to
individual elements. At the same time, it **cannot be overridden** on the
fields' or buttons' level. While technically possible, from the design point of
view it's undesirable to group elements of totally different types or sizes.

## Invisible Label

In some cases, it may be convenient to visually hide the group label. The label
remains accessible to assistive technologies. Labels of individual inputs are
always visually hidden.

While it may be acceptable for login screens with just a few fields or for other
simple forms, it's dangerous to hide labels from users in most cases. Keep in
mind you should **provide another visual clue** so users know what to fill into
the input.

<Playground>
  <InputGroup
    isLabelVisible={false}
    label="First and last name"
  >
    <TextField
      label="First name"
      placeholder="Eg. John"
    />
    <TextField
      label="Last name"
      placeholder="Eg. Doe"
    />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
</Playground>

## Horizontal layout

The default vertical layout is very easy to use and work with. However, there
are situations where horizontal layout suits better â€” and that's why React UI
supports this kind of layout as well.

<Playground>
  <InputGroup
    label="Horizontal layout"
    layout="horizontal"
  >
    <TextField label="Label" />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
</Playground>

## States

### Validation States

Validation states visually present the result of validation of the grouped
inputs. Input group's validation state is taken from its child inputs. You
should always **provide validation messages for states other than valid**
directly through `validationTexts` prop so users know what happened and what
action they should take or what options they have. These messages are not
semantically tied to the `children` elements, the connection should be expressed
in textual form in the actual message. The individual `children` elements must
not show any `validationText`, they only show their respective `validationState`.
Validation messages passed to input elements' `validationText` prop will be
ignored.

<Playground>
  <InputGroup
    label="First and last name"
    validationTexts={[
      "First name must be filled in.",
      "Last name must be filled in.",
    ]}
  >
    <TextField
      label="First name"
      placeholder="Eg. John"
      validationState="invalid"
    />
    <TextField
      label="Last name"
      placeholder="Eg. Doe"
      validationState="invalid"
    />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
  <InputGroup
    label="First and last name"
    validationTexts={[
      "Last name should not include any digits.",
    ]}
  >
    <TextField
      label="First name"
      placeholder="Eg. John"
      value="John"
    />
    <TextField
      label="Last name"
      placeholder="Eg. Doe"
      validationState="warning"
      value="123Doe"
    />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
  <InputGroup label="First and last name">
    <TextField
      label="First name"
      placeholder="Eg. John"
      validationState="valid"
      value="John"
    />
    <TextField
      label="Last name"
      placeholder="Eg. Doe"
      validationState="valid"
      value="Doe"
    />
    <Button label="Submit" />
  </InputGroup>
</Playground>

## Forwarding HTML Attributes

In addition to the options below in the [component's API](#api) section, you
can specify [React synthetic events] or **any HTML attribute you like.** All
attributes that don't interfere with the API are forwarded to the `<div>` HTML
element which wraps elements to be grouped. This enables making the component
interactive and helps to improve its accessibility.

ðŸ‘‰ Refer to the MDN reference for the full list of supported attributes of the
[div] element.
