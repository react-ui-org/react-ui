# TextField

TextField allows users to input text information.

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import { TextField } from './TextField'

## Basic Usage

To implement the TextField component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { TextField } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <TextField label="First name" />
</Playground>

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- Use the **most suitable input type** for current context: aside from the
  common `text` type, there are also `email`, `number`, `password`, and `tel`
  types at your disposal. A properly chosen input type is especially important
  for touch users as it triggers an appropriate virtual keyboard, so it helps
  speed up the completion of the field.

- **Beware of the `number` input type:** it may not be always what you want.
  Not all number-like values are actually numbers, e.g. phone numbers, credit
  card numbers, or business IDs. In such cases use the most appropriate input
  type (probably `text` or `tel`) along with the
  [`pattern` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern)
  to improve the input experience for touch users.

- Use **short and descriptive labels**, ideally nouns rather than seemingly
  polite phrases like _Please enter your first name_. Short labels will help
  your users accomplish their task faster.

- Only make the TextField's label invisible when there is **another visual
  clue** to guide users through filling the input.

- When a short label is not enough, use **help texts to guide users** before
  they enter anything.

- Optionally you can **pre-fill your text fields with a placeholder** to give
  users an example of what they're expected to fill in. Just remember the
  placeholder disappears once a value is entered so don't put anything important
  there. Usually, en example value starting with ‚ÄúEg.‚Äù works best.

- Use **clear, calm error messages** when there's a problem with what they
  entered. Be positive and focus on solutions to make the error message helpful.

- When asking users for their contact information or other personal information,
  make use of the
  [`autocomplete` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)
  to help them fill the form faster.

## Design Variants

To satisfy the design requirements of your project, all input fields in React UI
come in **two design variants** to choose from: outline and filled. Both can be
further [customized](#theming) with CSS custom properties.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="First name"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    variant="filled"
  />
</Playground>

## Sizes

Aside from the default (medium) size, two additional sizes are available: small
and large.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    size="small"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    size="large"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    size="small"
    variant="filled"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    variant="filled"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    size="large"
    variant="filled"
  />
</Playground>

Full-width fields span the full width of a parent:

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    fullWidth
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    variant="filled"
    fullWidth
  />
</Playground>

## Input Types

Aside from the common `text` type, there are also `email`, `number`, `password`,
and `tel` types at your disposal.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="Email"
    type="email"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Email"
    variant="filled"
    type="email"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Age"
    type="number"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Age"
    variant="filled"
    type="number"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Password"
    type="password"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Password"
    variant="filled"
    type="password"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Phone"
    type="tel"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Phone"
    variant="filled"
    type="tel"
  />
</Playground>

## Input Size

The default width of all inputs is 240 px, and it can be [customized](#theming)
with a CSS custom property. However, you can also **change the width of
individual text fields** using the `inputSize` property. It (obviously) sets the
`size` attribute of the `input` element and is further picked up by CSS to
normalize rendering across browsers.

üëâ Remember that the
[`size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text#size)
HTML attribute **does not limit on how many characters** the user can enter. Use
the `maxlength` attribute to achieve that effect.

üëâ Note that according to the HTML specification, the `inputSize` option (which
is translated as `size` attribute of the input element) is
[not available for the `number` input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#Controlling_input_size).

<Playground>
  <TextField
    inputSize={3}
    label="Title"
  />
  <TextField
    inputSize={3}
    label="Title"
    variant="filled"
  />
</Playground>

## Forwarding HTML Attributes

When you want to improve the accessibility of your text fields even further, you
can **add whatever HTML attribute you like.** All attributes that don't
interfere with [component's API](#api) are forwarded to the native HTML input.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="Address"
    autoComplete="street-address"
    minLength={3}
    maxLength={80}
  />
  <TextField
    label="Address"
    variant="filled"
    autoComplete="street-address"
    minLength={3}
    maxLength={80}
  />
</Playground>

üëâ Refer to the MDN reference for the full list of supported attributes of the
[text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text),
[email](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email),
[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number),
[tel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/tel), and
[password](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password)
input types.

## Invisible Label

In some cases, it may be convenient to visually hide the field label. The label
remains accessible to assistive technologies.

While it may be acceptable for login screens with just a few fields or for other
simple forms, it's dangerous to hide labels from users in most cases. Keep in
mind you should **provide another visual clue** so users know what to fill into
the input.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    isLabelVisible={false}
    placeholder="Eg. john@example.com"
  />
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    isLabelVisible={false}
    variant="filled"
    placeholder="Eg. john@example.com"
  />
</Playground>

## Horizontal Layout

The default vertical layout is very easy to use and work with. However, there
are situations where horizontal layout suits better ‚Äî and that's why React UI
supports this kind of layout as well.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    inputSize={3}
    label="Title"
    layout="horizontal"
  />
  <TextField
    inputSize={3}
    label="Title"
    layout="horizontal"
    variant="filled"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    variant="filled"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    fullWidth
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    variant="filled"
    fullWidth
  />
  <TextField
    isLabelVisible={false}
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    placeholder="First name"
    fullWidth
  />
  <TextField
    isLabelVisible={false}
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    placeholder="First name"
    variant="filled"
    fullWidth
  />
</Playground>

## Help Text

You may provide an additional help text to clarify how the input should be
filled.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    helpText="Choose one or more kinds of fruit to feel happy."
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    variant="filled"
    helpText="Choose one or more kinds of fruit to feel happy."
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    helpText="Choose one or more kinds of fruit to feel happy."
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    helpText="Choose one or more kinds of fruit to feel happy."
    variant="filled"
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    helpText="Choose one or more kinds of fruit to feel happy."
    fullWidth
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    layout="horizontal"
    variant="filled"
    helpText="Choose one or more kinds of fruit to feel happy."
    fullWidth
  />
</Playground>

Keep in mind that **long help texts don't play well with small input sizes,**
especially in a vertical layout. To fix this at least for the horizontal layout,
the help text expands over the full field width when the desired input width
(based on `inputSize` and `max` options) is 10 characters or smaller.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    inputSize={3}
    label="Title"
    layout="horizontal"
    helpText="What academic degree do you hold?"
  />
  <TextField
    inputSize={3}
    label="Title"
    layout="horizontal"
    variant="filled"
    helpText="What academic degree do you hold?"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Age"
    layout="horizontal"
    min={13}
    max={120}
    type="number"
    helpText="How old do you see yourself?"
  />
  <TextField
    label="Age"
    layout="horizontal"
    min={13}
    max={120}
    variant="filled"
    type="number"
    helpText="How old do you see yourself?"
  />
</Playground>

## States

### Validation States

Validation states visually present the result of validation of the input. You
should always **provide a validation message for states other than valid** so
users know what happened and what action they should take or what options they
have.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    validationState="valid"
    validationText="Looks good!"
    value="johnny1986"
    required
  />
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    validationState="warning"
    validationText="Account with this name already exists, pick a different one."
    value="joe"
    required
  />
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    validationState="invalid"
    validationText="Please enter a user name of your choice."
    required
  />
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    validationState="valid"
    validationText="Looks good!"
    variant="filled"
    value="johnny1986"
    required
  />
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    validationState="warning"
    validationText="Account with this name already exists, pick a different one."
    variant="filled"
    value="joe"
    required
  />
  <TextField
    label="User name"
    validationState="invalid"
    validationText="Please enter a user name of your choice."
    variant="filled"
    required
  />
</Playground>

### Disabled State

It's possible to disable the whole input.

<Playground>
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    value="John"
    disabled
  />
  <TextField
    label="First name"
    variant="filled"
    value="John"
    disabled
  />
</Playground>

## API

In addition to the options below, you can add any custom attributes that do not
interfere with the API, and they will be passed to the `input` HTML element.
This is useful mainly to improve component's
[accessibility](#forwarding-html-attributes).

<Props table of={TextField} />
