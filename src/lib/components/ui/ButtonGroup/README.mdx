# ButtonGroup

ButtonGroup visually groups related buttons together.

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import { Button } from '../Button/Button'
import { ButtonGroup } from './ButtonGroup'

## Basic Usage

To implement the ButtonGroup component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { ButtonGroup } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- Use button group to group **related actions** that a user can take. Buttons
  should not be grouped just to save space on the screen.

- Use **short labels or icons** so the buttons can fit small screens.

- For toggling between on/off states, use rather the
  [Toggle](/components/ui/toggle) component.

- For switching between options in a form that needs to be submitted, use rather
  the [SelectField](/components/ui/select-field) or
  [Radio](/components/ui/radio) components.

### Shared Properties

You can set the following properties directly on ButtonGroup to be shared for
all buttons inside the group: size, priority, disabled state, and block width.
These properties are then passed over to individual buttons. At the same time,
they **cannot be overridden** on the buttons' level. While technically possible,
from the design point of view it's undesirable to group buttons of totally
different types or sizes.

## Priorities

There are three **visual priorities** of buttons which exactly copy the
priorities of the [Button](/components/ui/button) component:

1. filled
2. outline
3. flat

### Filled

The default, high-emphasis priority should be used for primary actions of your
app.

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

### Outline

Medium-emphasis buttons to contain actions that are important but not primary
in your app.

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup priority="outline">
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

### Flat

Flat buttons are designed for less pronounced actions to help maintain focus on
the content.

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup priority="flat">
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

## Sizes

All existing button sizes are also available on the button group level: small,
medium, and large.

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup size="small">
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
  <ButtonGroup size="large">
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

Block button groups span the full width of a parent:

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup block>
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

## States

### Disabled State

Disables all buttons inside the group.

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup disabled>
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
  <ButtonGroup priority="outline" disabled>
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
  <ButtonGroup priority="flat" disabled>
    <Button label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

### Active State

To highlight the selected option, the active state can be achieved by setting
a different button variant for the active item.

<Playground>
  <ButtonGroup>
    <Button variant="dark" label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
  <ButtonGroup priority="outline">
    <Button variant="dark" label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
  <ButtonGroup priority="flat">
    <Button variant="dark" label="Week" />
    <Button label="Month" />
    <Button label="Year" />
  </ButtonGroup>
</Playground>

## Accessibility

You can improve the accessibility of your ButtonGroup by linking it to a label
and communicating the state of individual options.

<Playground>
  <>
    <span id="period-label">Period:</span>
    <ButtonGroup aria-labelledby="#period-label">
      <Button label="Week" aria-pressed variant="dark" />
      <Button label="Month" aria-pressed={false} />
      <Button label="Year" aria-pressed={false} />
    </ButtonGroup>
  </>
</Playground>

## API

<Props of={ButtonGroup} />
