# CheckboxField

CheckboxField allows users to select one or more options from a set.

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import { CheckboxField } from './CheckboxField'

## Basic Usage

To use the CheckboxField component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { CheckboxField } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <CheckboxField label="I agree" id="my-checkbox" />
</Playground>

## General Guidelines

- Use the CheckboxField when there are lists of options and the user may
  **select any number of choices,** including zero, one, or several. For
  selecting just a single option from the list, use either the
  [Radio](/components/ui/radio) or [SelectField](/components/ui/select-field)
  component.

- Use the CheckboxField for boolean (true/false) input **in forms that require
  to be confirmed** by a button to become active. To toggle things on or off
  with an immediate effect (without confirmation), use rather the
  [Toggle](/components/ui/toggle) component.

- **Use positive wording for the checkbox label,** so that it's clear what will
  happen when the user turns on the checkbox. Avoid negations such as ‚ÄúDon't
  send me any emails‚Äù which would mean that the user needs to turn the
  checkbox **on** in order for something **not** to happen.

- Only make the CheckboxField's label invisible when there is **another visual
  clue** to guide users through toggling the input.

- When a short label is not enough, use **help texts to guide users** before
  they enter anything.

- Use **clear, calm error messages** when there's a problem with what they
  entered.

- **Visually present groups of choices as groups,** and clearly separate them
  from other groups on the same page.

## Help Text

You may provide an additional help text to clarify what will be the impact of
turning the checkbox on or off.

<Playground>
  <CheckboxField
    label="Send me newsletter"
    id="my-checkbox-with-helper-text"
    description="We will not bother you more than once a month, we promise!"
    checked
  />
</Playground>

## Label Options

In some cases, it may be convenient to visually hide the checkbox label. The
label remains accessible to assistive technologies.

<Playground>
  <CheckboxField
    label="You cannot see this"
    id="my-checkbox-with-invisible-label"
    isLabelVisible={false}
    checked
  />
</Playground>

It's also possible to display the label before the input:

<Playground>
  <CheckboxField
    label="The label precedes the input"
    labelPosition="before"
    id="my-checkbox-with-label-before-input"
    checked
  />
</Playground>

## States

### Validation States

Validation states visually present the result of validation of the input. You
should always **provide a help text for states other than valid** so users know
what happened and what action they should take or what options they have.

<Playground>
  <CheckboxField
    label="I agree"
    id="my-checkbox-valid"
    validationState="valid"
    checked
  />
  <CheckboxField
    label="I agree"
    id="my-checkbox-warning"
    validationState="warning"
    description="Please wait 10 minutes until we verify your data."
    checked
  />
  <CheckboxField
    label="I agree"
    id="my-checkbox-invalid"
    validationState="invalid"
    error="You must agree to be able to proceed."
    required
  />
</Playground>

### Disabled State

Disabled state makes the input unavailable.

<Playground>
  <CheckboxField label="Disabled checkbox" id="my-checkbox-disabled" disabled />
  <CheckboxField
    label="Disabled checkbox, checked"
    id="my-checkbox-checked-disabled"
    disabled
    checked
  />
</Playground>
