# Paper

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import { Paper } from './Paper'

Paper is a basic surface to hold content.

## Basic Usage

To implement the Paper component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { Paper } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <Paper>
    Hello!
  </Paper>
</Playground>

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- Paper is **designed for non-white background.** You may want to either use its
  [raised variant](#raised-paper) or [customize](/customize/theming/overview)
  the default appearance to make it stand out on white background.

- **Paper, or Card?** Paper is a basic surface to put content on. However,
  there is also the [Card](/components/ui/card) component. While Paper is
  usually used to hold larger content areas like lists, grids, or forms, Card is
  designed for displaying items. Card also supports more visual options.

## Raised Paper

Add optional shadow to lift the paper above background.

<Playground>
  <Paper raised>
    Hello! I&apos;m paper and I&apos;m raised.
  </Paper>
</Playground>

## API

<Props table of={Paper} />
