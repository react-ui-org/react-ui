# Alert

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import Icon from '../../../../docs/_components/Icon'
import Button from '../Button'
import {
  AlertWithContext as Alert,
  Alert as ParsableAlert,
} from './Alert'

Alert presents feedback or important information to users.

## Basic Usage

To implement the Alert component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { Alert } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <Alert>
    Hello!
  </Alert>
</Playground>

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- **Be simple and short** and explain to users why you are interrupting them
  with an alert. Clearly say what happened or what is going to happen. Provide a
  brief title when the message is too long.

- **Use icons** to improve the accessibility of alerts because color may not be
  enough for everyone. [See how](#alerts-with-icons).

## Alert Types

There are six types of alerts (matching all available
[UI colors](/foundation/colors#ui-colors)) to cover all possible needs of your
project: note, success, warning, error, help, and info.

### Note (default)

When no type is specified, a neutral informative alert appears:

<Playground>
  <Alert>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This feature may not be available in all regions.
  </Alert>
</Playground>

### Success

Success alerts confirm that an operation has been processed successfully.

<Playground>
  <Alert type="success">
    <strong>Success:</strong> Settings have been successfully saved.
  </Alert>
</Playground>

### Warning

Use warning alerts when a potentially unfavourable situation may occur. You may
suggest an action to resolve the problem.

<Playground>
  <Alert type="warning">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Your credit card is going to expire soon.
    {' '}
    <a href="/">Update my payment options</a>
  </Alert>
</Playground>

### Error

Error alerts say there is something that block users from continuing that
requires their immediate attention. The alert should offer a solution to the
problem.

<Playground>
  <Alert type="error">
    <strong>Error:</strong> Cannot connect to the server. Is your internet
    connection working fine?
    {' '}
    <a href="/">Try again</a>
  </Alert>
</Playground>

### Help

This kind of alert can be used to display helpful information.

<Playground>
  <Alert type="help">
    <strong>Help:</strong> You should choose a password you don&apos;t use
    anywhere else.
  </Alert>
</Playground>

### Info

Another common, informative alert.

<Playground>
  <Alert type="info">
    <strong>Info:</strong> This feature depends on user&apos;s OS preferences.
  </Alert>
</Playground>

## Alerts with Icons

An icon can (and should) accompany the message.

ðŸ‘‰ Please note there are no icons pre-packed in React UI. Visit
[Icons](/foundation/icons) to see how it works.

<Playground>
  <Alert type="success" icon={<Icon icon="success" />}>
    <strong>Success:</strong> Settings have been successfully saved.
  </Alert>
</Playground>

## Dismissible Alerts

You can make an alert dismissible by providing a function that closes it on
click on the close button:

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [isAlertVisible, setIsAlertVisible] = React.useState(true);
    return (
      <>
        {isAlertVisible ? (
          <Alert
            type="success"
            icon={<Icon icon="success" />}
            closeHandler={() => setIsAlertVisible(false)}
          >
            <strong>Success:</strong> Settings have been successfully saved.
          </Alert>
        ) : (
          <Button
            clickHandler={() => setIsAlertVisible(true)}
            label="Show alert"
          />
        )}
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

<Props of={ParsableAlert} />
