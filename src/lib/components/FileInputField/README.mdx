# FileInputField

FileInputField allows users to select files to upload.

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import { FileInputField } from './FileInputField'

## Basic Usage

To implement the FileInputField component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { FileInputField } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <FileInputField label="Attachment" />
</Playground>

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- Apply [native HTML attributes](#forwarding-html-attributes) to control **what
  and how many files** users can select.

- Use **short and descriptive labels**, ideally nouns rather than seemingly
  polite phrases like _Please attach your file here_. Short labels will help
  your users accomplish their task faster.

- Only make the FileInputField's label invisible when there is **another visual
  clue** to guide users through filling the input.

- When a short label is not enough, use **help texts to guide users** before
  they enter anything.

- Use **clear, calm error messages** when there's a problem with what they
  entered. Be positive and focus on solutions to make the error message helpful.

ðŸ‘‰ FileInputField implements native HTML `input type="file"`. Therefore, it is
not possible to affect neither its translations (they depend on a browser), nor
appearance.
[Custom translations and appearance](https://github.com/react-ui-org/react-ui/issues/244)
are considered to be implemented at some point in the future. However, from the
layout perspective, FileInputFields work just like any other form fields.

## Sizes

Full-width fields span the full width of a parent:

<Playground>
  <FileInputField
    fullWidth
    label="First name"
  />
</Playground>

## Forwarding HTML Attributes

When you want to refine your file input fields even further, you
can **add whatever HTML attribute you like.** All attributes that don't
interfere with [component's API](#api) are forwarded to the native HTML input.

<Playground>
  <FileInputField
    accept=".pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png"
    helpText={`
      Choose up to 10 files. Allowed extensions are .pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, or .png.
      Size limit is 10 MB.
    `}
    label="Attachment"
    multiple
  />
</Playground>

ðŸ‘‰ Refer to the MDN reference for the full list of supported attributes of the
[file input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file)
type.

## Invisible Label

In some cases, it may be convenient to visually hide the field label. The label
remains accessible to assistive technologies.

While it may be acceptable for simple forms with just a few fields, it's
dangerous to hide labels from users in most cases. Keep in mind you should
**provide another visual clue** so users know what to fill into the input.

<Playground>
  <FileInputField
    isLabelVisible={false}
    label="Attachment"
  />
</Playground>

## Horizontal Layout

The default vertical layout is very easy to use and work with. However, there
are situations where horizontal layout suits better â€” and that's why React UI
supports this kind of layout as well.

<Playground>
  <FileInputField
    label="Attachment"
    layout="horizontal"
  />
  <FileInputField
    fullWidth
    isLabelVisible={false}
    label="Attachment"
    layout="horizontal"
  />
</Playground>

## Help Text

You may provide an additional help text to clarify how the input should be
filled.

<Playground>
  <FileInputField
    helpText="Choose one or more files to upload."
    label="Attachment"
  />
  <FileInputField
    helpText="Choose one or more files to upload."
    label="Attachment"
    layout="horizontal"
  />
  <FileInputField
    fullWidth
    helpText="Choose one or more files to upload."
    label="Attachment"
    layout="horizontal"
  />
</Playground>

## States

### Validation States

Validation states visually present the result of validation of the input. You
should always **provide a validation message for states other than valid** so
users know what happened and what action they should take or what options they
have.

<Playground>
  <FileInputField
    label="Attachment"
    validationState="valid"
    validationText="Looks good!"
  />
  <FileInputField
    label="Attachment"
    validationState="invalid"
    validationText="Your file is too big. Please select something smaller."
  />
  <FileInputField
    label="Attachment"
    validationState="warning"
    validationText={`
      You selected more than 10 files.
      It may take some time before we process them.
    `}
  />
</Playground>

### Disabled State

It's possible to disable the whole input.

<Playground>
  <FileInputField
    disabled
    label="Attachment"
  />
</Playground>

## API

In addition to the options below, you can specify [React synthetic events] or
any custom HTML attributes that do not interfere with the API, and they will be
passed to the `input` HTML element. This enables making the component
interactive and helps improve its [accessibility](#forwarding-html-attributes).

<Props table of={FileInputField} />
