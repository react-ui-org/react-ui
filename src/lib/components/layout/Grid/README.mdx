# Grid

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import { Placeholder } from '../../../../docs/_components/Placeholder/Placeholder'
import { Grid } from './Grid'

The responsive Grid layout aligns content into an organized grid.

## Basic Usage

To implement the Grid component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { Grid } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <Grid>
    <Placeholder bordered>Grid item</Placeholder>
    <Placeholder bordered>Grid item</Placeholder>
    <Placeholder bordered>Grid item</Placeholder>
    <Placeholder bordered>Grid item</Placeholder>
  </Grid>
</Playground>

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- To align your items in the grid, **simply wrap** them with the Grid
  component. Unlike other grid frameworks, **no additional markup** like
  GridItem or Cell is necessary. This is possible thanks to the
  [CSS grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout),
  the right tool for two-dimensional layouts.

- If you need your items to have **equal height** even with content of varying
  length, it may be necessary to set `height: 100%` on them.

ðŸ‘‰ The default column width algorithm is `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, auto))`
and it can be [customized](/customize/theming) with CSS custom properties.
More layout options are [coming soon](https://github.com/react-ui-org/react-ui/issues/149)!
