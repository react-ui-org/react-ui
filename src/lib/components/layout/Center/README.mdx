# Center

The Center layout aligns content both horizontally and vertically.

import {
  Playground,
  Props,
} from 'docz'
import { Placeholder } from '../../../../docs/_components/Placeholder/Placeholder'
import { Center } from './Center'

## Basic Usage

To use the Center component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { Center } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

<Playground>
  <Placeholder height="200px" bordered>
    <Center>
      <Placeholder bordered>
        Look, I&apos;m centered!
      </Placeholder>
    </Center>
  </Placeholder>
</Playground>

## General Guidelines

- The Center takes up all **available horizontal space and expands vertically**
  according to the length of its content. Depending on your layout, you may need
  to define the height of its parent to see the vertical alignment work.

- The Center layout uses `flexbox` for alignment. You may need to define the
  desired width of your centered content because it will be shrunk to the
  smallest possible width by default.

## API

<Props of={Center} />
