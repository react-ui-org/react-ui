// Optional layer with helper CSS classes to easily adjust visual details.
// Structured according to ITCSS methodology, ie. most importantly in ascending specificity.
// This file should be imported as the very last of your stylesheets.

// 1. Helpers
// ==========
//
// General purpose helpers for common situations. They can compose multiple CSS rules to do a bit
// more complicated tasks.

@use "styles/helpers/animation";

//
// 2. Utilities
// ============
//
// Utility classes to tweak small details like typography, margins or padding. They do just one
// thing: they set a single CSS rule and use the otherwise disallowed `!important` to enforce it.
// Also they are often responsive (can be adjusted for individual breakpoints).
