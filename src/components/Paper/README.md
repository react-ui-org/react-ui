# Paper

Paper is a basic surface to hold content.

## Basic Usage

To implement the Paper component, you need to import it first:

```js
import { Paper } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

And use it:

```docoff-react-preview
<Paper>
  Hello!
</Paper>
```

See [API](#api) for all available options.

## General Guidelines

- Paper is **designed for non-white background.** You may want to either use its
  [raised variant](#raised-paper) or [customize](/docs/customize/theming/overview)
  the default appearance to make it stand out on white background.

- **Paper, or Card?** Paper is a basic surface to put content on. However,
  there is also the [Card](/components/Card) component. While Paper is
  usually used to hold larger content areas like lists, grids, or forms, Card is
  designed for displaying items. Card also supports more visual options.

## Raised Paper

Add optional shadow to lift the paper above background.

```docoff-react-preview
<Paper raised>
  Hello! I&apos;m paper and I&apos;m raised.
</Paper>
```

## Muted Paper

Dim background and add transparency to visually suppress the Paper.

```docoff-react-preview
<Paper muted>
  Sssh! I&apos;m paper and I&apos;m muted.
</Paper>
```

## Forwarding HTML Attributes

In addition to the options below in the [component's API](#api) section, you
can specify [React synthetic events] or **any HTML attribute you like.** All
attributes that don't interfere with the API are forwarded to the root `<div>`
HTML element. This enables making the component interactive and helps to improve
its accessibility.

ðŸ‘‰ Refer to the MDN reference for the full list of supported attributes of the
[div] element.
