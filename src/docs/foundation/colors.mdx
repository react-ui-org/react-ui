# Colors

import Swatch from '../_components/Swatch'

Colors help you communicate the structure of your UI, emphasize any important
information, or signal different states of the UI. **Use colors intentionally**
â€” they are not a decoration, they should always serve a purpose.

ðŸ‘‰ You can adjust all custom properties on this page (and more) in your theme by
overriding values in the
[design tokens](/customize/theming/overview#design-tokens) section.

## General Guidelines

We have different shades for all of our **brand and UI colors** in React UI. The
following principles apply for them:

- Every color has **three additional shades** defined: light, dark, and darker.
  These additional shades should only be used for specific cases.
- **Light shade** of any color should only be used for background.
- **Dark shades** should be used for text on light shade background to improve
  contrast, or to reflect a state of a component (hover, focus, active).
- Every color suggests **what color should be used for text** placed on it. You
  don't have to think if black or white is better â€” just use `on-primary` for
  text on primary color background or `on-success` for success color background,
  and you should be safe.

A full scale of **shades of gray** is here at your disposal. But remember it's
better to choose just a couple of them rather than using all shades of gray
impulsively. **Reducing your gray color palette to three or four shades will
help you keep your UI clean** and unobtrusive.

All colors can be changed by [overriding](/customize/theming/overview) the
corresponding CSS custom properties.

## Brand Colors

Primary and secondary brand colors represent the visual identity of your
project.

<div>
  <Swatch color="primary" />
  <Swatch color="primary-dark" />
  <Swatch color="primary-darker" />
  <Swatch color="primary-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-primary" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="secondary" />
  <Swatch color="secondary-dark" />
  <Swatch color="secondary-darker" />
  <Swatch color="secondary-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-secondary" />
</div>

## UI Colors

UI colors communicate a meaning: green means success, orange means warning, red
means danger or error, etc.

<div>
  <Swatch color="success" />
  <Swatch color="success-dark" />
  <Swatch color="success-darker" />
  <Swatch color="success-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-success" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="warning" />
  <Swatch color="warning-dark" />
  <Swatch color="warning-darker" />
  <Swatch color="warning-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-warning" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="danger" />
  <Swatch color="danger-dark" />
  <Swatch color="danger-darker" />
  <Swatch color="danger-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-danger" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="help" />
  <Swatch color="help-dark" />
  <Swatch color="help-darker" />
  <Swatch color="help-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-help" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="info" />
  <Swatch color="info-dark" />
  <Swatch color="info-darker" />
  <Swatch color="info-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-info" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="note" />
  <Swatch color="note-dark" />
  <Swatch color="note-darker" />
  <Swatch color="note-light" />
  <Swatch color="on-note" />
</div>

## Grays

Shades of should be used to communicate structure, either with backgrounds, or
with borders. They are all neutral grays, which means they are derived from pure
white color (`#fff`).

<div>
  <Swatch color="white" />
  <Swatch color="gray-50" />
  <Swatch color="gray-100" />
  <Swatch color="gray-200" />
  <Swatch color="gray-300" />
  <Swatch color="gray-400" />
  <Swatch color="gray-500" />
  <Swatch color="gray-600" />
  <Swatch color="gray-700" />
  <Swatch color="gray-800" />
  <Swatch color="gray-900" />
  <Swatch color="black" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="light" />
  <Swatch color="dark" />
  <Swatch color="muted" />
</div>

## Applying Colors

Components can apply non-gray colors above using one of the following color
palettes.

### Component Colors

Some components ([Alert](/components/alert), [Badge](/components/badge),
and more) come in more color variants to help you better reflect their
importance or nature of their content. Following colors are available in such
cases:

- basic shades of all **brand colors**: `primary` and `secondary`,
- basic shades of all **UI colors**: `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `help`,
  `info`, and `note`,
- selected shades of **gray**: `light` (neutral shade to stand out on dark
  surfaces) and `dark` (neutral shade to stand out on light surfaces).

There is always a reasonable default for the component in question which can be
changed to any of supported values above through the `color` prop.

### Validation States

All form field components that support validation states
([CheckboxField](/components/checkbox-field),
[TextField](/components/text-field), [Toggle](/components/toggle) and
more) apply selected [UI colors](#ui-colors) for individual states:

- `success` UI color for **valid** state,
- `warning` UI color for **warning** state,
- `danger` UI color for **invalid** state.

Validation state is always optional so default styling is applied for the
component when its `validationState` prop is not specified.
