# Colors

import Swatch from '../_components/Swatch'

Colors help you communicate the structure of your UI, emphasize any important
information, or signal different states of the UI. **Use colors intentionally**
â€” they are not a decoration, they should always serve a purpose.

ðŸ‘‰ All colors on this page can be changed by
[overriding](/customize/theming/overview) values in your
[design tokens](/foundation/design-tokens).

## General Guidelines

- **All colors in React UI are strictly semantic: they always target a specific
  use case. You are encouraged to apply any color palettes you want and map them
  onto the semantic colors of React UI.**
- In general, all colors in React UI are for either **static** (text colors and
  most of the background colors) or **interactive** use cases (action colors,
  feedback colors). However, some colors are designed to be either of them:
  neutral colors can be used for both static and interactive parts, similarly to
  primary border color.
- Interactive color variants always define **hover** and **active** (pressed)
  states.
- Many colors suggest **what color should be used for text** placed on them. You
  don't have to think if black or white is better â€” just use `on-primary` for
  text on primary color background or `on-success` for success color background,
  and you should be safe.

## Text Colors

Colors reserved for text. The text can have primary or secondary priority. Both
priorities can be suppressed with the `disabled` variants.

<div>
  <Swatch color="text-primary" />
  <Swatch color="text-primary-disabled" />
  <Swatch color="text-secondary" />
  <Swatch color="text-secondary-disabled" />
</div>

## Action Colors

Action colors communicate the **importance** of an action which can be primary
or secondary. Using the `selected` color, you can also mark an action as the one
currently selected. Last but not least, the action colors define the color of
links, too.

<div>
  <Swatch color="action-primary" />
  <Swatch color="action-primary-hover" />
  <Swatch color="action-primary-active" />
  <Swatch color="action-on-primary" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="action-secondary" />
  <Swatch color="action-secondary-hover" />
  <Swatch color="action-secondary-active" />
  <Swatch color="action-on-secondary" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="action-selected" />
  <Swatch color="action-selected-hover" />
  <Swatch color="action-selected-active" />
  <Swatch color="action-on-selected" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="action-link" />
  <Swatch color="action-link-hover" />
  <Swatch color="action-link-active" />
</div>

## Feedback Colors

Feedback colors help communicate a **meaning**: green means success, orange
means warning, and red means danger or error. On top of that, there are a few
more feedback colors to fit various situations.

<div>
  <Swatch color="feedback-success" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-success-hover" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-success-active" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-on-success" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="feedback-warning" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-warning-hover" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-warning-active" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-on-warning" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="feedback-danger" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-danger-hover" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-danger-active" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-on-danger" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="feedback-help" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-help-hover" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-help-active" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-on-help" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="feedback-info" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-info-hover" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-info-active" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-on-info" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="feedback-note" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-note-hover" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-note-active" />
  <Swatch color="feedback-on-note" />
</div>

## Neutral Colors

Neutral colors are intended for neutral variants of components that support
colors. The light color works well with dark backgrounds. Conversely, the dark
color stands out on light backgrounds.

<div>
  <Swatch color="neutral-light" />
  <Swatch color="neutral-light-hover" />
  <Swatch color="neutral-light-active" />
  <Swatch color="neutral-on-light" />
</div>
<div>
  <Swatch color="neutral-dark" />
  <Swatch color="neutral-dark-hover" />
  <Swatch color="neutral-dark-active" />
  <Swatch color="neutral-on-dark" />
</div>

## Background Colors

Colors reserved for backgrounds.

### Content Layers

Backgrounds for the fundamental UI areas and layered content.

ðŸ‘‰ Content layers can be separated from background using their
[shadow counterparts](/foundation/shadows): `background-layer-1` +
`shadow-layer-1` etc.

<div>
  <Swatch color="background-base" />
  <Swatch color="background-layer-1" />
  <Swatch color="background-layer-2" />
</div>

### Component Backgrounds

Basic backgrounds for components.

ðŸ’¡ What is the difference between `background-base` and `background-basic`?
While the _base_ background is intended for the bottom-most layer of your UI,
the _basic_ background is the default go-to background for components.

<div>
  <Swatch color="background-basic" />
  <Swatch color="background-disabled" />
</div>

### Interactive Areas

Backgrounds to highlight interactive areas on hover and during interaction.

ðŸ’¡ Please note the default interactive background is always transparent so it
does not get in the way of the underlying component background.

<div>
  <Swatch color="background-interactive" />
  <Swatch color="background-interactive-hover" />
  <Swatch color="background-interactive-active" />
</div>

### Action Backgrounds

Backgrounds for areas with actionable content.

<div>
  <Swatch color="background-primary" />
  <Swatch color="background-secondary" />
  <Swatch color="background-selected" />
</div>

### Feedback Backgrounds

Backgrounds for feedback areas.

<div>
  <Swatch color="background-success" />
  <Swatch color="background-warning" />
  <Swatch color="background-danger" />
  <Swatch color="background-help" />
  <Swatch color="background-info" />
  <Swatch color="background-note" />
</div>

### Neutral Backgrounds

Neutral backgrounds to help you structure your content.

<div>
  <Swatch color="background-light" />
  <Swatch color="background-dark" />
</div>

## Border Colors

Colors reserved for borders. With borders, you can separate content areas,
components, or their parts. For interactive context, you should always use the
primary border.

<div>
  <Swatch color="border-primary" />
  <Swatch color="border-primary-hover" />
  <Swatch color="border-primary-active" />
  <Swatch color="border-secondary" />
</div>

## Applying Colors

Components can apply colors above using one or more of the following color
palettes.

### Component Colors

Some components ([Alert](/components/alert), [Badge](/components/badge),
[Button](/components/button), and more) come in more color variants to help you
better reflect their importance or nature of their content. Following colors
are available in such cases:

- **action colors (actionable components only):** `primary`, `secondary`, and
  `selected`,
- **feedback colors:** `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `help`, `info`, and
  `note`,
- **neutral colors:** `light` and `dark`.

There is always a reasonable default for the component in question which can be
changed to any of supported values above through the `color` prop.

### Validation States

All form field components that support validation states
([CheckboxField](/components/checkbox-field),
[TextField](/components/text-field), [Toggle](/components/toggle) and more)
apply selected [feedback colors](#feedback-colors) for individual states:

- `success` feedback color for **valid** state,
- `warning` feedback color for **warning** state,
- `danger` feedback color for **invalid** state.

Validation state is always optional so default styling is applied for the
component when its `validationState` prop is not specified.
