# Design Tokens

Design tokens are a [methodology] for **expressing design decisions** in a
platform-agnostic way so that they can be shared across different disciplines,
tools, and technologies. They help establish a common vocabulary across
organisations.

React UI features dozens of design tokens, represented by
[CSS custom properties](/customize/theming/overview), to help you customize the
system according your design needs.

## Design Token Types

### Global Tokens

Global tokens represent the basic, context-agnostic decisions in your design
language. They define color palettes, typography scales, or spacing values,
without binding them to any semantic meaning.

ðŸ’¡ **Global tokens are not part of React UIâ€”they are part of your design
system.**

```css
:root {
  --pantone-3145c: #00778b;
}
```

### Alias Tokens

Alias tokens are special variables that define the smallest
pieces of a design language, especially colors, typography, or spacing, for a
specific context.

ðŸ‘‰ **Alias tokens are your starting point for
[customization](/customize/theming/overview) of React UI.**

```css
:root {
  --rui-color-action-primary: var(--pantone-3145c);
}
```

### Component-specific Tokens

Representation of values associated with a component. They often inherit from
alias tokens. Once you are done with the
[customization](/customize/theming/overview) of the alias tokens, you can
further fine-tune the components by adjusting the component-specific tokens.

```css
:root {
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--default__background: var(--rui-color-action-primary);
}
```
