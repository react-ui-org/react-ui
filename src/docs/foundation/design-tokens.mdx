# Design Tokens

Design tokens are a [methodology] for **expressing design decisions** in a
platform-agnostic way so that they can be shared across different disciplines,
tools, and technologies. They help establish a common vocabulary across
organisations.

ðŸ‘‰ Design tokens are your starting point for
[customization](/customize/theming/overview) of React UI to fit your design
system needs.

## Design Token Types

### Global Tokens

Global tokens represent the basic, context-agnostic decisions in your design
language. They define color palettes, typography scales, or spacing values,
without binding them to any semantic meaning.

```css
:root {
  --pantone-3145c: #00778b;
}
```

ðŸ’¡ **Color palettes are part of your design system language. Hence, React UI
does not try to suggest any color palette related design tokens. Instead, you
are encouraged to create the color palette tokens yourself as necessary.**

### Alias Tokens

Alias tokens are special variables that define the smallest pieces of a design
language, especially colors, typography, or spacing, for a specific context.

```css
:root {
  --rui-color-action-primary: var(--pantone-3145c);
}
```

### Component-specific Tokens

Representation of values associated with a component. They often inherit from
alias tokens. Once you are done with the
[customization](/customize/theming/overview) of the alias tokens, you can
further fine-tune the components by adjusting the component-specific tokens.

```css
:root {
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--default__background: var(--rui-color-action-primary);
}
```
