# CSS Guidelines

Basic rules to follow when authoring React UI CSS.

## Coding Style

React UI uses [Stylelint] to avoid errors in CSS and enforce unified coding
style in all stylesheets.

Configurations used:

- [`stylelint-config-visionapps`][stylelint-config-visionapps] — a more strict
  extension of popular community preset
  [`stylelint-config-standard`][stylelint-config-standard].

- [`stylelint-config-visionapps-order`][stylelint-config-visionapps-order] —
  an opinionated list of CSS properties order.

## CSS Modules

React UI uses [CSS modules] to take advantage of writing native CSS while
keeping component class names short and unique by obfuscating them with random
suffix.

### Components

For example, this JSX:

```jsx
// Button.jsx

<button className={styles.root}>
  <span className={styles.beforeLabel}>{beforeLabel}</span>
  <span className={styles.label}>{label}</span>
  <span className={styles.afterLabel}>{afterLabel}</span>
</button>
```

… with this SCSS:

```scss
// Button.scss

.root {
 // …
}

.beforeLabel {
 // …
}

.afterLabel {
 // …
}

.label {
  // …
}
```

… produces following CSS class names:

- `Button__root__2yVxr5IZ`
- `Button__beforeLabel__1rrmrrWj`
- `Button__afterLabel__38eMTilM`
- `Button__label__23iTNlfS`

Resulting CSS class names are both human-readable and unique at the same time
which is convenient for development. Class names are further shortened and
obfuscated for production environments.

### Helpers and Utilities

There are also global helper and utility classes (both documented as CSS Helpers
for the sake of comprehensibility for non-CSS guys) that can be used by
developers and thus remain unaltered by CSS modules. For example,
`:global(.display-block)` SCSS selector produces `display-block` CSS class.

## Class Name Rules

Following rules make it clear both in JSX and CSS what is affected by a CSS
class.

1. **Class names must use pascalCase notation** to be usable in JavaScript
   context.

2. **Short, preferably single-word names should be chosen for all component
   elements.** No naming convention like BEM or SUIT CSS needs to be applied
   since class names are unique in the global scope thanks to CSS modules.

3. **Component's top-level HTML element must have `root` class name.**
   However, this rule has a few exceptions:

   1. When the component is a subcomponent, it's usually better to use
      subcomponent's name, e.g. `item` or `group`. This enables us to keep
      related CSS of both the main component and its subcomponents in a single
      file and see the big picture during development.

   2. When no CSS on the root element is necessary and styling only takes place
      once a visual modification is invoked by component props, `root` class
      name can be omitted entirely.

4. **Modifier class names related to the current HTML element must start with
   `is`** and contain the name of the target element, e.g. `isRootLoading`
   (modifies `root`) or `isLabelHidden` (modifies `label`). However, child
   elements may be modified as well, e.g. by a CSS selector like
   `.isRootRequired > .label` (root is marked as required but the label is what
   needs to be visually modified).

5. **Modifier class names related to child elements must start with `has`**
    and refer to the element in question, e.g. `hasRootSmallInput` (applies on
   `root` but relates to `input`).

## Custom Properties

React UI takes advantage of supporting [modern browsers] and uses
[CSS custom properties] to make writing and maintaining CSS more efficient.

There are three kinds of custom properties used:

1. `--rui-custom-*` for any custom properties whose value comes from component's
   API. May reuse other custom property types.

2. `--rui-local-*` for internal (component-scoped) custom properties. May reuse
   other custom property types.

3. `--rui-*` (unscoped) for theme-related custom properties. Part of public API,
   designed to be [customized]. Must not reuse other custom property types.
