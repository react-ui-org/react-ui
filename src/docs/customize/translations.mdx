# Translations

Some components may contain texts which improve components' accessibility.
All texts are in English by default and can be translated to other languages.

## Translation Approaches

Structure of translations can be found in file
`src/lib/translations/en.json` or in a documentation of props of components
that support translations.

1. You can use `RUIProvider` component and pass translated structure
   from this file into `RUIProvider` as `translations` prop to
   overwrite default translations. You have to define all translations for all
   components, otherwise it will not work.
2. Other option is to overwrite translations locally using `translations` prop
   of specific component. You have to define all translations as well.

### Local Translations

If component supports translations, `translations` prop and its structure is
present in props documentation for a specific component.

To define translations locally, you need to import component first (e.g. Modal):

```js
import { Modal } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

Then pass `translations` prop object:

```jsx
<Modal translations={{ close: 'Close' }}>
  // ...
</Modal>
```

### Global Translations

To define translations globally, you need to import `RUIProvider` first:

```js
import { RUIProvider } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
```

Then wrap application (or its part) with `RUIProvider` with `translations` prop object.

```jsx
<RUIProvider translations={{
    Alert: {
      close: 'Close',
    },
    Modal: {
      close: 'Close',
    },
    ScrollView: {
      next: 'Next',
      previous: 'Previous',
    },
  }}>
  <Modal>
    // ...
  </Modal>
</RUIProvider>
```
