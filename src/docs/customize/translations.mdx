# Translations

Some components contain help texts or tooltips which improve components'
accessibility. All texts are in English by default and can be translated to
other languages.

## Translation Approaches

Structure of translations can be found in file
`src/lib/translation/TranslationContext.jsx`.

1. You can use `TranslationProvider` component and pass translated structure
   from this file into `TranslationProvider` as `translations` props to
   overwrite default translations.

2. Other option is to overwrite translations locally using `translations` props
   of specific component.
