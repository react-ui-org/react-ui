# Theming

From the very beginning, React UI has been designed with a great emphasis on
customizability. We decided to leverage CSS custom properties for this feature
for two main reasons:

1. We believe in **power of native CSS**. Preprocessors are still a thing, but
   it's not necessary to go as far as for CSS-in-JS to make a UI customizable.

2. Thanks to its JavaScript API, CSS custom properties are both **readable and
   writable from JS code**.

## Theming Options

CSS custom properties are used to define common visual properties like colors,
fonts, borders, shadows, or spacing. They come prefixed with `rui-` so they
don't get in way of other custom properties in your project.

Example `theme.scss`:

```scss
:root {
  // Brand colors
  --rui-color-primary: #00778b;
  --rui-color-primary-light: #{lighten(#00778b, 70%)};
  --rui-color-primary-dark: #{darken(#00778b, 4%)};
  --rui-color-primary-darker: #{darken(#00778b, 8%)};
  --rui-color-on-primary: #fff;
  --rui-color-secondary: #fa4616;
  --rui-color-secondary-light: #{lighten(#fa4616, 45%)};
  --rui-color-secondary-dark: #{darken(#fa4616, 4%)};
  --rui-color-secondary-darker: #{darken(#fa4616, 8%)};
  --rui-color-on-secondary: #fff;
}
```

It is also possible to adjust some properties on individual components level,
preferably by reusing the global settings:

```scss
:root {
  // Alerts: common properties
  --rui-alert-border-width: var(--rui-border-width);
  --rui-alert-border-radius: var(--rui-border-radius);
  --rui-alert-padding: var(--rui-spacing-2);
}
```

You can adjust any of these options in your styles. See the
[default theme](https://github.com/react-ui-org/react-ui/blob/master/src/lib/theme.scss)
for the full list of available settings.

Ô∏èüëâ Please note that **breakpoint values are exported as read-only** since CSS
custom properties
[cannot be used within media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#using-variables)
(because media query is not a CSS property).

## Best Practices

It's a good idea to start with changing the **global settings first**. Widely
reused settings such as colors, typography, borders or spacing values should be
adjusted first because they define the basic appearance of all components.

Having finished the customization at the global level, you can **then proceed to
customize the appearance of individual components** ‚Äî if necessary at all. Even
then you should also reuse existing global settings as much as possible to
ensure that your UI is consistent and works as a system.

For the same reason, if you have any custom components in your UI, you should
**reuse the global theming options in your own CSS**, too.
