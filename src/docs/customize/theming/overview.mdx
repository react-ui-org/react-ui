# Theming

From the very beginning, React UI has been designed with a great emphasis on
customizability. We decided to leverage CSS custom properties for this feature
for two main reasons:

1. We take advantage of possibilities of **native CSS**. Preprocessors are still
   a thing, but it's not necessary to go as far as for CSS-in-JS to make a UI
   customizable.

2. Thanks to JavaScript API, CSS custom properties are both **readable and
   writable by JS**.

## Theming Options

[Design tokens](/foundation/design-tokens) are used to define common visual
properties like colors, fonts, borders, shadows, or spacing. CSS custom
properties are the technical representation of the design tokens in React UI.

All CSS custom properties in React UI come prefixed with `rui-` so they don't
get in way of other custom properties in your project.

Just like the design tokens, the custom properties come grouped according to
their type:

1. alias design tokens,
2. component-specific tokens.

You can adjust any of the properties in your styles. See the [default theme] for
the full list of available custom properties.

### Alias Design Tokens

The alias token names are not complex nor long, so they are simply lowercase and
hyphenated.

The alias token names are written in the following format:

`--rui-<type>-[<group>]-<name>-[<state>]`

Where:

- `<type>` is one of: `color`, `dimension`, `font-family`, `font-weight`,
  `shadow`, as suggested by the [Design Tokens Format][dtf] proposal. However,
  additional custom types like `font-size`, `line-height`, or `text-decoration`
  are also used as they prove necessary.
- `<group>` optionally groups multiple related values, e.g. `text`,
  `background`, `action`, etc.
- `<name>` is the name of the token, e.g. `primary`, `base`, or `light`. Scales
  can be presented as numbered sequences, e.g. `space-[0-7]`, `size-[1-6]`, etc.
- `<state>` describes additional interaction variants of the token: `hover`,
  `active`, `disabled`.

Example alias design tokens represented by CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --rui-color-text-primary: #000;
  --rui-dimension-space-3: 0.75rem;
  --rui-font-family-base: "Titillium Web", helvetica, roboto, arial, sans-serif;
}
```

Ô∏èüëâ Please note that **breakpoint values are exported as read-only** since CSS
custom properties [cannot be used within media queries][w3c-custom-properties]
(because a media query is not a CSS property).

### Component-Specific Tokens

It is also possible to adjust some properties on individual components level,
preferably by reusing (inheriting) the alias design tokens.

Due to higher complexity, component-specific tokens use a naming convention that
many web developers will find familiar because it works like [BEM] (with
prefixes and component name syntax taken from [SUIT CSS], to be precise):

`--rui-<ComponentName>--[<modification(s)>]__[<element>]--[<modification(s)>]__<property>--[<modification>]`

Where:

- `<ComponentName>` stands for actual component name (e.g. `Button`,
  `FormField` etc.) with a reasonable exception to form fields whose settings
  are widely shared and therefore grouped as `FormField` options.
- `<modifications(s)>` can be one or more modifiers, typically a variant (e.g.
  `primary`, `filled`, `box`) or interaction state (`default`, `hover`,
  `focus`, `active`, `disabled`).
- `<element>` stands for a nested element of the component.
- `<property>` is usually a CSS property (e.g. `color`, `background`,
  `background-color`, `width`, `box-shadow`), or a brief property description
  where a CSS property wouldn't tell enough (e.g. `initial-offset`,
  `check-background-color`, `tap-target-size`).

Example component-specific custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--default__color: var(--rui-color-action-on-primary);
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--default__border-color: var(--rui-color-action-primary);
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--default__background: var(--rui-color-action-primary);
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--default__box-shadow: none;
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--hover__color: var(--rui-color-action-on-primary);
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--hover__border-color: var(--rui-color-action-primary-hover);
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--hover__background: var(--rui-color-action-primary-hover);
  --rui-Button--filled--primary--hover__box-shadow: none;
}
```

### CSS, or SCSS?

Colors, breakpoints, and SVG definitions used in `theme.scss` are preprocessed
with SCSS first. This enables us to:

- generate our internal color palette programmatically,
- keep actual breakpoint values in a single place in the code,
- keep `theme.scss` uncluttered by inline SVG.

It's entirely up to you what format you decide to use for storing the theme.
Both `theme.scss` and `theme.css` will work equally well. It only matters if the
custom properties make it from the theme file to browser.

üëâ Just remember everything in the [theme constants] directory is intended only
for usage within `theme.scss`. Otherwise, the theming system may not work as
expected. We recommend calling custom properties from `theme.scss` either
directly in your stylesheet, or through an intermediate, shareable layer like
`MyComponent/_theme.scss` or
`styles/shared-by-components/_my-sass-variables-referring-to-theme.scss`
(latter of which is the approach we use).

## Best Practices

It's a good idea to start with changing the **alias design tokens first**.
Widely reused settings such as colors, typography, borders, or spacing values
should be adjusted first because they define basic appearance of all components.

Having finished the customization at the global level, you can **then proceed to
customizing the appearance of individual components** ‚Äî if necessary at all.
Even then you should also reuse existing alias design tokens as much as
possible to ensure that your UI is consistent and works as a system.

For the same reason, if you have any custom components in your UI, you should
**reuse the alias design tokens in your own CSS** too.
