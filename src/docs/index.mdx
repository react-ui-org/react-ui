**React UI is a themeable UI library for React apps.**

---

React UI consists of four building blocks:

1. **Foundation CSS:** basic themeable CSS layer. **Mandatory ground zero for
   components.**

2. **Components:** reusable and themeable React components and layouts:
   [buttons](/components/ui/button), [cards](/components/ui/card),
   [lists](/components/layout/list), and more.

3. **Theme:** a collection of CSS custom properties that define the visual
   appearance of the UI.

4. **Helper and utility CSS classes (optional):** tiny CSS classes with
   notation **inspired by Bootstrap.** They can handle details like
   [typography](/utilities/typography), [spacing](/utilities/spacing),
   [colors](/utilities/colors), etc.
