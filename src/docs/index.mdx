# React UI

**React UI is a themeable and performant UI library for React apps.**

Make your UI look like Bootstrap, Material Design or almost any other design
just with a few lines of CSS!

---

## Key Concepts

Why another UI library? Because we couldn't find any library that would meet
these requirements:

- **ðŸŽ¨ Full control over design.** Hundreds of CSS custom properties allow you
  to customize the design of your app without touching any JS.

- **ðŸ“¦ Zero configuration needed.** Create rapid prototypes that look great with
  smart defaults and no additional effort.

- **ðŸš€ Small bundle size.** Because performance matters.

## What's Included

React UI consists of four building blocks:

1. **Foundation CSS:** basic themeable CSS layer. **Mandatory ground zero for
   components.**

2. **Components:** reusable and themeable React components and layouts:
   [buttons](/components/ui/button), [cards](/components/ui/card),
   [lists](/components/layout/list), and more.

3. **Theme:** a collection of CSS custom properties that define the visual
   appearance of the UI.

4. **Helper CSS classes (optional):** tiny CSS classes with notation
   **inspired by Bootstrap.** They can handle details like
   [typography](/css-helpers/typography), [spacing](/css-helpers/spacing),
   [colors](/css-helpers/colors), etc.
