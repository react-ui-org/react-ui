# Theming

From the very beginning, React UI has been designed with a great emphasis on
customizability. We decided to pick CSS custom properties for this feature for
two main reasons:

1. We believe in **power of native CSS**. Preprocessors are still a thing, but
   it's not necessary to go as far as for CSS-in-JS to make a UI customizable.

2. Thanks to its JavaScript API, CSS custom properties are both **readable and
   writable from JS code**.

## Theming Options

CSS custom properties are used to define common visual properties like colors,
fonts, borders, shadows, or spacing. They come prefixed with `rui-` so they
don't get in way of other custom properties in your project.

Example `theme.scss`:

```scss
:root {
  // Brand colors
  --rui-color-primary: #00778b;
  --rui-color-primary-light: #{lighten(#00778b, 70%)};
  --rui-color-primary-dark: #{darken(#00778b, 4%)};
  --rui-color-primary-darker: #{darken(#00778b, 8%)};
  --rui-color-on-primary: #fff;
  --rui-color-secondary: #fa4616;
  --rui-color-secondary-light: #{lighten(#fa4616, 45%)};
  --rui-color-secondary-dark: #{darken(#fa4616, 4%)};
  --rui-color-secondary-darker: #{darken(#fa4616, 8%)};
  --rui-color-on-secondary: #fff;
}
```

It is also possible to adjust some properties on individual components level,
preferably by reusing the global settings:

```scss
:root {
  // Alerts: common properties
  --rui-alert-border-width: var(--rui-border-width);
  --rui-alert-border-radius: var(--rui-border-radius);
  --rui-alert-padding: var(--rui-spacing-2);
}
```

See the [default theme](https://github.com/react-ui-org/react-ui/blob/master/src/lib/theme.scss)
for the full list of available settings.

️👉 Please note that **breakpoint values are exported as read-only** since CSS
custom properties
[cannot be used within media queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#using-variables)
(because media query is not a CSS property).

️👉️ Please note that CSS custom properties are only supported by modern browsers.
Refer to [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables) for
compatibility overview.

## Best Practices

### Customization Approaches

There are two approaches to customization of your project:

1. **Load the default React UI theme** as is and **override** just selected
   settings in your project's theme. This approach is useful when you are
   going to make just a couple of small adjustments, and it also performs
   better.

2. **Copy the default React UI theme** to your project and **change**
   whatever is needed. The default theme is not loaded in this case. This
   approach is better for making major visual changes. Just **remember to always
   check for any new custom properties when upgrading React UI** in your
   project.

### The Process of Customization

It's a good idea to start with changing the **global settings first**. Widely
reused settings such as colors, typography, borders or spacing values should be
adjusted first because they define the basic appearance of all components.

Having finished the customization at the global level, you can **then proceed to
customize the appearance of individual components** — if necessary at all. Even
then you should also reuse existing global settings as much as possible to
ensure that your UI is consistent and works as a system.

For the same reason, if you have any custom components in your UI, you should
**reuse the global theming options in your own CSS**, too.
