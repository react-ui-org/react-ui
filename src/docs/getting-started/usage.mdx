# Usage

## Responsive Meta Tag

React UI is designed and developed mobile-first, a strategy in which we first
write code for mobile devices, and then scale up components as necessary using
CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices,
add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>` element:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

## Fonts

React UI is designed with the Titillium Web font. Add it to your project eg. via
Google Fonts in your `<head>` element:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Titillium+Web:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Remember to include all necessary font weights (and only them ‚Äî for better
performance).

## Foundation CSS

React UI honors ITCSS principles to make sure that its CSS code base will work
and perform well even in large scale. There are two global CSS layers:

- **Theme:** a collection of hundreds of CSS custom properties that define the
  look of your app. See [Theming](/getting-started/theming) for more.
- **Foundation:** the ground-zero CSS for React UI components. Includes global
  resets and fixes rendering inconsistencies across browsers with
  `normalize.css`. Not to be confused with the Foundation CSS framework.

Import the two global CSS layers as early as possible in your document:

```js
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/theme.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/foundation.scss';
```

‚ö†Ô∏è As of now, you will need **working SASS pipeline** for this to work. This is
to be changed to a ready-to-use CSS in the future.

Ô∏èüëâÔ∏è Because of using CSS custom properties, it is technically possible to import
the theme layer anywhere later in the app. But it's a nice habit to declare
variables before using them.

## Components

Import and use any of React UI components in your app:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';

<Button label="My Button" />
```

## Full Example

Example HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>React UI Example</title>
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Titillium+Web:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Example JSX:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/theme.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/foundation.scss';

const App = () => (
  <Button label="My Button" />
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));
```

## Helpers and Utilities

Helpers and utilities are tiny CSS classes that can handle details like
[typography](/utilities/typography), [spacing](/utilities/spacing),
[colors](/utilities/colors), etc.

While the **utility classes do just one thing** (they set a single CSS rule and
use the otherwise disallowed `!important` to enforce it) and are often
responsive (can be adjusted for individual breakpoints), the **helper classes
can compose multiple CSS rules** to do a bit more complicated tasks.

To use helpers and utilities, just import them along the base CSS layers of
React UI:

```js
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/theme.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/foundation.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/helpers.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/utilities.scss';
```

The class name notation is
[inspired by Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/), so if you
are familiar with Bootstrap, you will feel at home here.
