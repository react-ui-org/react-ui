# Usage

## Responsive Meta Tag

React UI is designed and developed mobile-first, a strategy in which we first
write code for mobile devices, and then scale up components as necessary using
CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices,
add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>` element:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

## Fonts

React UI is designed with the Titillium Web font. Add it to your project e.g. via
Google Fonts in your `<head>` element:

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Titillium+Web:wght@300;400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

Remember to include all necessary font weights (and only them ‚Äî for better
performance).

## Foundation CSS

React UI honors [ITCSS][itcss] principles to make sure that its CSS code base
will work and perform well even in large scale. There are two global CSS layers:

- **Theme:** a collection of hundreds of CSS custom properties that define the
  look of your app. See [Theming][theming] for more.
- **Foundation:** the ground-zero CSS for React UI components. Includes global
  resets and fixes rendering inconsistencies across browsers with
  `normalize.css`. Not to be confused with the Foundation CSS framework.

Import the two global CSS layers as early as possible in your document:

```js
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/theme.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/foundation.scss';
```

‚ö†Ô∏è As of now, you will need **working SASS pipeline** for this to work. This is
to be changed to a ready-to-use CSS in the future.

Ô∏èüëâÔ∏è Because of using CSS custom properties, it is technically possible to import
the theme layer anywhere later in the app. But it's a nice habit to declare
variables before using them.

## Components

Import and use any of React UI components in your app:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';

<Button label="My Button" />
```

### Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

While you may find out some components are working for you as uncontrolled, we
currently support only [controlled components][controlled-components].

## Full Example

Example HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>React UI Example</title>
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Titillium+Web:wght@300;400;700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Example JSX:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Button } from '@react-ui-org/react-ui';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/theme.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/foundation.scss';

const App = () => (
  <Button label="My Button" />
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));
```

## CSS Helpers

CSS helpers are tiny CSS classes that can handle details like
[typography][typography], [spacing][spacing], [colors][colors], etc.

To use CSS helper classes, just import them along the base CSS layers of
React UI:

```js
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/theme.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/foundation.scss';
import '@react-ui-org/react-ui/src/lib/helpers.scss';
```

Class name notation is [inspired by Bootstrap][bootstrap-utilities], so if you
are familiar with Bootstrap, you will feel at home here.
